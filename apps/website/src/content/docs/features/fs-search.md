In addition to web & AI search, Grinta allows you to search your files and folders.

## File System Search

You can search your files and folders by typing your query into the search bar.
You can also use any set of consecutive letters contained within the name of the file or folder.

For example, if there's a file named "alphabet", you could search for "phab".

## Custom Extensions

You can add support for additional file extensions in the Settings panel. This allows you to search for files with extensions that are not supported by default.

## Search Scope

By default, Grinta searches across all accessible directories. You can limit the search to your home directory only by enabling the "Search only in home directory" option in Settings.

## Configuring Search Settings

All file system search settings can be found in the Settings panel under the "General" tab:
- Add or remove custom file extensions
- Toggle home directory-only search
- View supported file types
