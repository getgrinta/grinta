In addition to web & AI search, Grinta allows you to search your files and folders.

## File System Search

You can search your files and folders by typing your query into the search bar.
You can also use any set of consecutive letters contained within the name of the file or folder.

For example, if there's a file named "alphabet", you could search for "phab".
