The Natural Language Processing (NLP) feature allows you to get essential information using the natural language queries.

## Currency Conversion

You can convert currencies using queries like `100 chf to eur`. It also works with the popular crypto assets.

If you won't provide `to` part, it will convert to the default currency that you can adjust in settings.

## Date Operations

If you need to calculate the date, you can use queries like `45 days from now`.
