description: Connect and manage your calendar events directly within Grinta.
---

Grinta integrates with your system's calendar application to bring your events into the command palette.

## Setup

To enable calendar integration:

1.  Navigate to Settings > Features > Calendar.
2.  Click the "Authorize" button to grant Grinta permission to access your calendar data. If permission is denied, a button will be available to open the macOS System Settings directly to the Calendar Privacy section.
3.  Once authorized, select the specific calendars you want Grinta to display events from.

## Features

-   **View Upcoming Events**: See your upcoming events directly in the command palette.
-   **Event Details**: Events will display the title, start/end times (often shown relative to the current day, e.g., "Today at 2:00 PM"), and location.
-   **Calendar Color & Name**: Each event item displays a color indicator matching its source calendar, with the calendar name shown in a tooltip.
-   **Calendar Filtering**: Only events from your selected calendars will be shown.

## Configuration

The calendar settings allow you to manage permissions and choose which calendars are active within Grinta. If you have previously ignored specific events via a context menu action, a button to "Reset Ignored Events" will appear here, allowing you to make them visible again. Layout adjustments have been made to ensure these settings are presented clearly.
