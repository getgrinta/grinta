2.  Click the "Authorize" button to grant Grinta permission to access your calendar data.
3.  Once authorized, select the specific calendars you want Grinta to display events from.

## Features

-   **View Upcoming Events**: See your upcoming events directly in the command palette.
-   **Event Details**: Events will display start and end times, location, and notes (if available).
-   **Calendar Filtering**: Only events from your selected calendars will be shown.

## Configuration

The calendar settings allow you to manage permissions and choose which calendars are active within Grinta. Layout adjustments have been made to ensure these settings are presented clearly.
