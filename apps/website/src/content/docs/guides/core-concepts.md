In this guide you'll learn how to make the most out of Grinta.

## Navigation

We have designed the navigation to be intuitive. Each screen of the application has keyboard shortcuts
so you'll barely have to use mouse. Take this for example:

![Home](/docs/home.png "Home")

If you are feeling lost on any screen, simply hold `Command` key. It will reveal shortcut labels.

## Switching Modes

The application has two main modes: search and notes. You can switch between them using the `Command+1` and `Command+2` shortcuts.

## Menu

The menu is accessible via the `Command+k` shortcut. This shortcut works on pretty much every screen of the application.
